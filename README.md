# Jumpstart Guides

Jumpstart Guides uses [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) to generate our guides.

The root folder of all our guides can be found in the `docs` folder.

To add a page, create a new Markdown file (e.g. `example.md`) and update the table of contents by editing `_sidebar.md`.

## Themes

There are several themes to choose from. We are currently using [docsify-themeable](https://jhildenbiddle.github.io/docsify-themeable/#/themes).
