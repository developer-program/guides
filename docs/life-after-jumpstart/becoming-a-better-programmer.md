# Becoming a better programmer

## Mindset

> “I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits.”

-- Kent Beck

Often times the difference between a mediocre programmer and a good one boils down to their habits.

## Mental models

When trying to learn about atoms, we are presented with models. These models do not accurately represent how atoms really look like in real life, but they help us mentally visualize them in order for us to grasp their behavior and concepts.

Similarly, we use models to understand and navigate around our digital world. Having good mental models that more accurately represent how things work in the real world will mean a deeper understanding of their behavior and how to debug code when things go wrong.
