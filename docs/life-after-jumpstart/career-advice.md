## Resume

A resume is often the first thing recruiters see. They should leave a good first impression.

### Past experience

Having experience outside of the tech industry can work to your advantage. For instance, if you were previously in the finance industry, your past experience might be useful to fintech startups.

If you were a designer, you might have an advantage with user interfaces and user experiences, especially if you're geared towards a role as a frontend developer.

The bottom line is your experience matters and can add value to your future employer. It's a matter of how you sell yourself and demonstrate that you are a valuable asset to the company.

### Simple, clean design

Though you might be tempted to add a lot of color and borders to your resume, remember that it has to look good even in black and white. Often what looks good on the screen might not look good in print.

If a recruiter was to print your resume they are unlikely to print it in color or configure borderless printing. Just like your code, keep a simple and clean design for your resume.

### Know your stuff

When adding a list of technologies, frameworks, libraries, tools, or concepts in your resume, you want to keep in mind that these may be used to test you during a technical interview. So if you put it in your resume, you have to be able to talk about it during interviews.

While you should certainly add a list of skills to your resume, we caution against using a rating based system because these ratings are subjective. You might rate yourself one-star for React, when someone else might consider you to be rated three-stars.

I was interviewing a candidate once and they wrote that they applied SOLID principles in a project, but when I quizzed them on it they were not able to talk about it. This suggests that they were merely adding terms to their resume to make themselves stand out more, but then lack the substance to back it up.

### Links

You can use a URL shortener to create short and memorable links to put on in your resume. Having concise links means they take up less space and are much easier to type into a browser.

Keep in mind that if you decide to use icons for your links they can only be clicked when viewed on a computer or mobile device. Your links should be clickable, but if they are printed you want them to be visible, too.

You could experiment with QR codes, but we suggest limiting this to just one QR code that links to a portfolio, for example.

## Portfolio

You should have a portfolio website to showcase the various projects you have built. These projects are a good way for other developers and prospective employers to quickly gauge the quality of your work. Be sure to include links to the deployed site as well as the source code.

### Deploying your portfolio website

We do not recommend deploying frontend applications on Heroku's free tier because your application will sleep. When recruiters visit your portfolio website they are made to wait for quite a long while. This might not leave a good impression on them.

Heroku is suitable for backend applications. Instead, for frontend applications, use a service like Netlify, Surge, or Now.

### Show off your work

For each project, list down all the technologies and libraries that you used. If you wrote tests, be sure to mention that as well. You can even show your test coverage report.

### Don't limit yourself

You're not limited to web applications. There are many different types of apps and services that you can build, so you shouldn't limit yourself to just web applications.

Try building mobile applications with React Native or Flutter, build chat bots for Slack or Telegram, build desktop applications with the Electron framework, or build backend services with a public API. You can dabble in cloud technologies like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform or how about building a serverless application.

## Social media

### LinkedIn

We're not saying that it's necessary to create a LinkedIn account, but if you do have one its important to keep it up to date. You can be sure that recruiters will search for your LinkedIn account, so make sure it's updated.

LinkedIn is also useful when connecting with people you meet at meet up events and conferences. Start by following all of your classmates and fellow jumplings in the alumni. You can join the [LinkedIn group for Jumpstart](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/10489915/).

Be sure to include a link to your LinkedIn account on your resume and online portfolio.

### GitHub

A lot can be learned from a developer's GitHub account. How often they push code, how many projects that have created, how many open source software they have contributed to. The more activity you are on GitHub the more you can stand out.

GitHub is also a good way to connect with other developers, so be sure to follow people on GitHub.

Be sure to include a link to your GitHub account on your resume and online portfolio.
