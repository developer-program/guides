Brandan Eich created JavaScript in 10 days in May 1995, under duress and conflicting management imperatives — “make it look like Java,” “make it easy for beginners,” “make it control almost everything in the Netscape browser.”

Now, JavaScript has become the language of the web. To date, JavaScript is the only programming language with built-in support in all major web browsers for client-side application scripting. Moreover, in recent years, JavaScript has become a popular language for implementing server-side applications with the advent of the Node.js platform. In the last three years, JavaScript has changed drastically.

JavaScript has its idiosyncracies and gotchas, which we will discover over the course of working with it. But it can also be a very powerful tool in our toolkit, if we understand it and use it well.
Here is a good overview of the JavaScript landscape as of 2018:
