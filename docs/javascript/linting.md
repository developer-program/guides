# Linting

## What is linting
Linting is to automatically check the code for syntax and style errors and potential run-time errors.
It is a type of static analysis for code. Static analysis is analysing the source code directly without running the code.

## What is ESLint
[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is, as the website describes, the **"pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX"**.

ESLint also reports deviations from specified coding guidelines. These coding guidelines are often defined by the team. Error messages identify the violated rules, making it easy to adjust their configuration if you disagree with the defaults.

Languages that require compilers have a way to give feedback to developers before code is executed. Since JavaScript doesn't require a compiler, linters are needed to play that role.
You can take a look at the [type of issues that can be detected by ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/).
