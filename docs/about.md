## Prerequisites for JumpStart

JumpStart is not suitable for absolute beginners. We expect you to already be familiar with basic levels of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

JumpStart is designed for advanced beginners who have some experience in web development. You should have some experience building a simple website in HTML and CSS.

You should also be familiar with basic programming concepts like loops, conditional statements, variables, and data types. You may refer to this checklist of [JavaScript Fundamentals](https://javascript.info/first-steps).

If you are not familiar with these concepts we highly recommend that you first learn these concepts before applying to JumpStart.
