# Data structures and algorithms

## Data structures

> The difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.

-- Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux and Git

## Algorithms

> An algorithm must be seen to be believed.

-- Donald Knuth, author of *The Art of Computer Programming*
