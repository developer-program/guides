# Data structures

Good data structures can make the code easier to design and maintain, whereas the best code can't make up for poor data structures.

> The difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.

-- Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux and Git
