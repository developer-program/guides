# Agile software delivery

## Agile manifesto

## Agile principles

## Agile methodologies and frameworks

The agile manifesto does not dictate how we should go about delivering software. As a result several flavors have emerged. They include Extreme Programming, Scrum, Kanban, and many others.

In a typical software development team, you might hear terms like product backlog, product owner, sprints, and retrospectives. These come from [Scrum](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html).

Other terms like pair programming, test-driven development, iterations, user stories, spikes, stand up meetings, and continuous integration come from [Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/index.html).

### Retrospective

A retrospective is a way for us to look back at the work we've done in the sprint and reflect on them so as to improve the way we work together. There are some great resources online for suggestions on ways to conduct a [fun retrospective](http://www.funretrospectives.com).

#### [Energizer](http://www.funretrospectives.com/category/energizer/)

This is a very short fun activity to reset ourselves from what we were previously working on and get ourselves ready for the meeting. The activity should be fun and not work or programming related.

#### Check-in

It's important to learn if everyone in the team is willing to share during a retrospective meeting. Check-ins help get a sense of how everyone is feeling.

#### Prime directive

Before starting a retrospective, get everyone to recite the prime directive. It's important that the entire team recite it together because we want to enforce the idea that we are all trying to do the best we can within our limitations.

> Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.

#### Retrospective

#### Action items

Action items emerge from the discussions of the retrospective and people (usually in pairs or even the entire team) are assigned to be responsible for each item.

#### Check-out

This is a very short activity to end the entire session.
