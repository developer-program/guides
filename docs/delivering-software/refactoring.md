# Refactoring

> Refactoring (noun): a change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior.

-- Martin Fowler, Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code

Martin Fowler, the Chief Scientist at ThoughtWorks, has written a second edition of his classic book [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Existing-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0134757599) which uses JavaScript in their examples.

In test driven development, we first write one failing test, we then write the minimum amount of code to pass the test, and lastly, we refactoring the code without adding any new functionality. This is an essential part of test driven development. It is not enough that we have code that works, but code that is also well written and easier to extend for future development.

We can apply the same ideas in the [broken window theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory) in software development. When we have a well organized closet, its easy for us to find the clothes we want. When we have to do the laundry, we're more inclined to keep it organized. However, if we have a disorganized closet it takes a lot more effort to keep the closet tidy when we have to do the laundry.

We recommend getting hands-on practice when learning refactoring. Here are two popular katas for you to practice:
