# Prerequisites and preparations

## Prerequisites for JumpStart

Due to the fast pace of the program, JumpStart is not suitable for absolute beginners. We expect you to already be familiar with basic levels of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

JumpStart is designed for advanced beginners who have some experience in web development. You should have some experience building a simple website in HTML and CSS.

You should also be familiar with basic programming concepts in JavaScript. Use this checklist to see if you have the necessary knowledge of [JavaScript Fundamentals](https://javascript.info/first-steps).

If you are not familiar with these concepts we highly recommend that you first learn them before applying to JumpStart.

## Preparing for JumpStart

### Learn touch typing

Software developers do a lot of typing for their work. Touch typing is when you're typing with all your fingers and without having to look at the keyboard.

We recommend using an online typing tool like [keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) to practice your typing speed.
