1. Sign enrollment agreement - an enrollment agreement contract will be sent to you via email for you to read and accept our terms

1. Make payment for the program - you will be given instructions on how to make payment for the program

## Meet program prerequisites

As this is an accelerated program, it is important that you meet _all_ our prerequisites.

Check that you meet our [prerequisites](/introduction/prerequisite) before applying to the program.

## Complete self-assessment

We ask that you complete this self-assessment as a way for you to assess yourself on your level of competency.
We recommend that you complete the self-assessment twice - once in whatever programming language you prefer (e.g. Python, Ruby, C++) and then again in JavaScript.

If you already know a programming language (e.g. Python) then picking up another language (e.g. JavaScript) is relatively straightforward. You can use these two resources to help you with learning a new programming language:

- [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/javascript) - a quick reference to common operations performed in JavaScript

- [Reference for scripting languages](http://hyperpolyglot.org/scripting) - a side-by-side reference sheet for JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and PHP

Things to take note of:

1. No imposed time limits
2. Attempt these problems as many times as you like

### A note on the assessment

The purpose of the assessment is to evaluate your readiness for the program. If you are not ready, take a couple of months to prepare yourself for the program by following some of our recommended online learning resources.

Our assessment is designed to be challenging, but not too hard to complete. If you find yourself struggling to complete the assessment then you may want to reassess your proficiencies again.

### A note on cheating

Our platform is able to detect plagiarism and monitors any attempts to cheat.

If you are found to be cheating, your application will be rejected. If you were accepted into the program, you will be asked to withdraw from the program without any compensation.

Realize that when you decide to cheat, you are ultimately cheating yourself.

## Phone interview

You will receive an email from us for you to book an appointment with us for a short phone interview.

This phone interview is for us to learn more about you, your motivations for joining the program, and your level of commitment.

We will also ask you questions relating to your previous work experience and your aspirations after completing the program.
