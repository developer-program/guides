### A note on the assessment

The purpose of the assessment is to evaluate your readiness for the program. If you are not ready, take a couple of months to prepare yourself for the program by following some of our recommended online learning resources.

Our assessment is designed to be challenging, but not too hard to complete. If you find yourself struggling to complete the assessment then you may want to reassess your proficiencies again.

### A note on cheating

Our platform is able to detect plagiarism and monitors any attempts to cheat.

If you are found to be cheating, your application will be rejected. If you were accepted into the program, you will be asked to withdraw from the program without any compensation.

Realize that when you decide to cheat, you are ultimately cheating yourself.

## Phone screening

We will arrange for a phone screening with you to assess your motivations for joining the program and your level of commitment. We will also ask you questions relating to your previous work experience and your aspirations after completing the program.
